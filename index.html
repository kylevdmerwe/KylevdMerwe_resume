				<h3>The Early Years</h3>
					<p>
					Born in Swakopmund, Namibia, I then grew up in Johannesburg. Growing up I always had a passion and enthusiasm with computers.
					I built my first PC when i was 12, after winning a CPU and Motherboard from a Intel competition at my school.
					Since then I have enjoyed programming and gaming on computers, consoles and mobile devices.

				<h3>High School</h3>
					<p>
					After high school I moved to Stellenbosch to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 
					While I enjoyed the Electronic part of the course, I was not so enthusiastic about the electrical. 
					5 years later I started working at Elsumo, still without a complete degree.

				<h3>Recently</h3>
					<p>
					Elsumo is a pump importer, installation and service company. I was hired as a Operations and Technical Assistant, 
					but ended up being very involved with almost every aspect of the technical side of the company. 
					From Pump selection, Quoteing, Electronic Control design and isntalation, I have been integral in the day to day 
					running of the engineering department.					
					After working for so many years at Elsumo, I have felt again the call from the computer industry. 
					HyperionDevs Software Engineering course has refreshed my computer and programming experience, 
					and I am now looking for a career shift into something more IT based.
